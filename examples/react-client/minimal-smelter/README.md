# Minimal Smelter Example App

This is an example app demonstrating how to send custom audio/video to Fishjam.

The example uses [Smelter](https://smelter.dev) to add a dynamic overlay to the user's camera.
You can also use libraries like [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) to render custom streams and send them to a videoconference room.

## Running

Install dependencies with `yarn`, run with `yarn dev`.
The app should be available at http://localhost:3008.
